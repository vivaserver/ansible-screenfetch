## Requirements

A Debian or Ubuntu-based system.

## Dependencies

No role dependencies, only Git.

## Example Playbook

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: vivaserver.screenfetch }
